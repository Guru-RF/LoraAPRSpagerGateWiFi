Lora APRS Pager Gateway (TX) WiFi

Idea's:
Automatic location pin-point via co-user with tracker ....
Or via api (web app ?)

POC:
Beacon every 5 minutes (so pager know's it is in a receiving area and displays some sort of signal strength and witch gateway it's receiving from, also sends timestamp so pager does not need an RTC)
